Select "1 minute" for now, at which point the controls will briefly disable while Mobility starts up.<br /><br />

Once completed, you should see a "running man" icon in the notification bar, indicating that Mobility is currently collecting your activity trace. Note that you can always revisit this screen to disable Mobility whenever you like.<br /><br />

The area below the "Sampling Interval" control shows the modes that Mobility has detected over the past 20 minutes. It is common for the first few to be "error" as Mobility takes a little while to calibrate itself.<br /><br />

Activity data is only periodically uploaded to ohmage; each activity classification for a moment is called a "point." "To upload" indicates how many points are still in your phone's memory, waiting to be uploaded. "Total" indicates how many points have been collected so far. "Last upload time" display the time at which the application attempted to push the points on the phone to the server. Finally, the "Upload Now" button allows you to force the phone to upload all the points in its memory, which should cause "To Upload" to drop to zero.<br /><br />

Press "Upload Now", which will ensure that the server has the most recent copy of your data, then press "Analytics" or swipe to the left to continue.</p>

The screen is split into two main portions: a daily activity summary and a weekly summary of hours of activity per day. The last two statistics ("Average amount of activity during baseline" and "Last Week") are still works in progress and are not yet implemented. <br /><br />

The first portion, daily summary, shows a daily sum of the number of minutes you've spent in each of the four activity modes: still, walking, running, or driving. The second portion shows a total for each day of the number of hours you spent performing physical activity (that is, not still or driving.)<br /><br />

The topmost section contains a few summarizing statistics about your day -- the amount of time you've been sedentary, ambulatory, how far you've traveled without driving, and finally how much time Mobility has been tracking total, regardless of your activity mode.<br /><br />

The center section is a color-coded strip that shows your activity throughout the day, with the x-axis indicating the time of day. Consult the legend on the right to determine which colors correspond to which activity modes.<br /><br />

The bottom section displays comparisons of your activity modes. The lefthand bottom side displays the number of meters traveled by driving versus running. The righthand bottom section displays the amount of time spent in each mode as a bar graph.<br /><br /></p>

Click an icon to display detailed information about that point, including the GPS coordinates, accuracy reading, and the time at which it was collected.<br /><br />

If there are too many points to display in a location, they will be "collapsed" into a cluster which displays the number of points at that place.

This view is different from the previous views -- rather than specifying a single day, you can specify a range of days over which to construct the view. This view is more useful if you want to get an overview of multiple days, but you can still use it for a single day as well. In this case, select today's date as both the start and end date.<br /><br />

The "Temporal Summary" shows a color-coded activity bar (identical to the one on the "Daily Summary" view) for each day in the specified range. By having multiple bars from a range of days visible on the same page, one should be able to detect patterns in activity on timescales larger than a single day.<br /><br /></p>

Given a large enough range of dates, the view displays the change in daily duration and/or distance traveled for a particular activity over time.<br /><br />

The top portion of the view allows you to select whether to plot duration, distance, or both. The mode selection allows you to choose a particular activity mode on which to focus. (Note that "still" is disabled when "Distance in Meters" is checked, as it is impossible to travel while still.)<br /><br />

The bottom portion displays a line-graph, with time on the x-axis, and the chosen metrics forming the y-axes. If both duration and distance are selected as metrics, the duration scale will be displayed on the left and the distance will be displayed on the right. Using this view, you can determine how a particular activity mode fluctuates over time.<br /><br /></p>

                    <p style="line-height: 150%;">In this tutorial, you learned how to install Mobility, control it to gather activity data, and review that data both on the phone and on the web dashboard. Remember that you can disable Mobility whenever you like, and that your activity data is considered sensitive and thus held in confidence.<br /><br />

From here, it's probably a good idea to keep Mobility running for a few days so that you can identify interesting patterns in your activity. If you find that your battery life is negatively impacted, you can change the sampling interval to 5 minutes in the Mobility configuration screen.</p>
