<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.ohmage">Ohmage on Google Play</a><br /><br />

Since Ohmage is a rich data-stream aggregator, it requires significantly more permissions than your average app. All data collected will be held in keeping with the terms of service you reviewed in the last step; if you have any questions or concerns, you can always contact the Ohmage maintainers.<br /><br />

If you have your phone handy, you may take a picture of the QR code on the right with scanning software to link you directly to Ohmage on Google Play.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Campaigns:</b> In ohmage, a collection of surveys is referred to as a data-collection campaign. In this section, you can view the campaigns in which you're participating or find a new campaign to join.</li>
<li><b>Surveys:</b> Presents a list of surveys for all of the campaigns in which you're participating. The list can be filtered to only show surveys from a specific campaign, but by default shows them all.</li>
<!--
<li><b>Response History:</b> A calendar of survey responses you've submitted in the past. Each day displays the number of surveys you've taken on that day (or is blank if you didn't take any) and can be touched to show a list of the surveys taken on that day.</li>
-->
<li><b>Upload Queue:</b> A list of surveys that you've completed which are pending upload. You can manually submit individual surveys here or choose how to resolve issues with failed survey uploads.</li>
</ul>

                    <p style="line-height: 150%;">We can now browse a list of campaigns available on the server. This list (and most lists in ohmage) is comprised of two parts:

<ol>
<li>the <b>main action,</b> which takes up most of the space in the list element, and usually takes you to  a page with information about the list item
<li>the <b>sub-action</b>, the icon on the righthand side of the list, which generally performs the most common action for that list item.
</ol>

In this case, the main action shows information about the campaign, and the sub-action downloads and participates in the campaign directly.<br /><br />

We're going to look at the information for the "Demo Snack" campaign, so click the lefthand side of that campaign's entry in the list.</p>

                    <p style="line-height: 150%;">Surveys consist of a series of questions where each question is one of a few different types (multiple choice, free text, camera capture, etc.)<br /><br />

Surveys can be navigated at will via the "Previous" and "Next" buttons, although most questions require a valid response before continuing. If a question can be skipped, a "Skip" button will appear in between the "Previous" and "Next" buttons, allowing you to proceed without supplying a value.</p>

                    <p style="line-height: 150%;">The upload queue provides a means to review surveys that are pending upload.<br /><br />

You may also choose to manually upload specific surveys by clicking the sub-action button for the survey. If the survey failed to upload before, you'll see an error icon instead of the normal upload icon, which you may click to choose how to resolve the issue. Finally, you may batch upload all pending surveys using the "Upload All" button at the bottom.<br /><br />

Go ahead and click "Upload All" to push the survey you answered before to the ohmage server. We'll review it later via the website.</p>
